# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! 🎄✨ 

This is where I'll be sharing my solutions and thoughts as I tackle the coding challenges throughout December.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles. Each day, a new challenge is unlocked, and the puzzles often involve a mix of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. It's a great way to have fun, learn new things, and celebrate the holiday season with fellow coders around the world.

## Getting Started

If you want to explore my solutions or use this repository for your own learning:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tobias-Pe/advent-of-code`
2. Navigate to the day you're interested in 🗺️
3. Check out the solution code!

Feel free to use, modify, or share my code as you see fit. If you have improvements or suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

## Acknowledgments

A special thanks to the creators of Advent of Code and the community that makes this event so enjoyable!

Happy coding and may your solutions be bug-free! 🚀🎁
